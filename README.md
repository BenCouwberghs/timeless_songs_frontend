# Timeless Songs - Front end
## Description
Welcome to my project. This is a web app on which you can look up bands, see the songs they've made
and more. 
## Used technologies
We created the front end using Angular 20, as we have experience using Angular, 
while choosing the latest stable version to stay up to date with Angular in question.

Beyond that this project also uses the Tailwind framework and the PrimeNG library.
## Reason for this project
There are several reasons why I'm doing this project, with the help of my mentor.
First and foremost is continuing improving my expertise with Angular 
and be able to showcase such a project as part of my portfolio.
This project is also my first introduction to PrimeNG and learning what is possible with it.
Next is working on improving my skills with VCS and specifically GitHub as I am somewhat lacking in this field,
but this project has already seen great improvements for me with this.
